# HaskellFunctions
A small collection of functions created in Haskell to demonstrate competency.

These functions were made to fulfil a coursework specification as Loughborough University. I recieved a first (94%) for my work.

The project is split into 4 parts:

  * Part 1: Creates the custom data type 'Dog' and modifies a list of 'Dogs' using several functions.
  * Part 2: Builds flag and step patterns based on width and height inputs.
  * Part 3: Determines whether two people like, admire, hate, or are indifferent to each based on a set of rules applied to their names.
  * Part 4: A collection of polymorphic functions.
